"""
Jira connector: issues assigned to and reported by a person.

`lookup-cli jira <identifier>` shows the issues currently assigned to
someone; `-r` shows what they reported.

Three facts about Jira Cloud drive this module's shape. All were
established by probing the real instance on 2026-09-07, not read from
documentation -- the docs and most tutorials still describe the old API.

**`/rest/api/3/search` is gone.** It answers `410 Gone` with a pointer to
`/rest/api/3/search/jql`. Anything built against the old endpoint fails for
every user, so there is a test pinning that we never call it.

**The new endpoint refuses unbounded JQL** ("Please add a search
restriction to your query") and pages with an opaque cursor
(`nextPageToken` + `isLast`) rather than `startAt` offsets. Most
importantly it returns **no `total`**: there is no cheap way to learn how
many issues someone has. Reporting the page size as a count would
understate a workload, and quietly-wrong answers are the failure mode this
whole tool exists to avoid -- so an incomplete page is reported as "at
least N", never as N.

**JQL cannot take a username.** GDPR-era changes removed usernames and
emails from JQL; a query must use an `accountId`. So a lookup is two steps:
resolve the identifier via `/user/search`, then query with the id. Passing
a username instead matches nothing *without* erroring, which is exactly the
kind of silent empty answer worth guarding against.

**Scope (decided 2026-09-07).** The default view is *assigned* issues, with
reported available via `-r`. Assigned is the actionable set: open work that
needs reassigning when someone leaves, or that says what they are stuck on.
Reported is historical. On the real instance the two differ substantially
for the same person, so they are shown under separate headings and never
merged into one count.

**Looking up one issue.** `lookup-cli jira ENG-1` shows a single ticket.
The identifier is normally a person, but an issue key is distinctive enough
(`ABC-123`) to detect without guessing -- an email always carries an `@`,
and a display name never has the letters-hyphen-digits shape. Detection is
case-insensitive because Jira itself is: the API answers 200 for
`eng-42` as readily as the uppercase spelling.

There is deliberately no fallback from a failed key lookup to a person
search. A string shaped like an issue key that Jira does not know is a
typo, not a colleague.

Required env vars (see `.env.example`):
    JIRA_BASE_URL       e.g. https://your-org.atlassian.net
    JIRA_EMAIL          the account the API token belongs to
    JIRA_API_TOKEN      an API token (Basic auth, email:token)
Optional:
    JIRA_TIMEOUT_SECONDS        per-request timeout (default 10)
    LOOKUP_CLI_MOCK_JIRA=1      serve a fixture instead of calling out
